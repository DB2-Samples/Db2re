    "# Db2 (RESTful) Jupyter Notebook Extensions Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL code tutorials for Db2 rely on a Jupyter notebook extension, commonly refer to as a \"magic\" command. The beginning of all of the notebooks begin with the following command which will load the extension and allow the remainder of the notebook to use the `%sql` magic command.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "&#37;run db2re.ipynb\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a Jupyter/Python magic command called `%sql` which allows you to execute Db2 specific calls to \n",
    "the database. There are other packages available for manipulating databases, but this one has been specifically\n",
    "designed for demonstrating a number of the SQL features available in Db2 using RESTful calls. Note that this code will **only** work for a Db2 on Cloud instance and is not supported for connecting to a standard Db2 server. To use this code on with a Db2 server run the **`db2.ipynb`** command instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of executing the `%sql` command. A single line SQL statement would use the\n",
    "line format of the magic command:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%sql SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a large block of sql then you would place the `%%sql` command at the beginning of the block and then\n",
    "place the SQL statements into the remainder of the block. Using this form of the `%%sql` statement means that the\n",
    "notebook cell can only contain SQL and no other statements.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%%sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "ORDER BY LASTNAME\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have multiple lines in the SQL block (`%%sql`). The default SQL delimiter is the semi-column (`;`).\n",
    "If you have scripts (triggers, procedures, functions) that use the semi-colon as part of the script, you \n",
    "will need to use the `-d` option to change the delimiter to an at @ sign. \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%%sql -d\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "@\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE ...\n",

    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%sql` command allows most DB2 commands to execute and has a special version of the CONNECT statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CONNECT command has the following format:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%sql CONNECT CREDENTIALS <variable>\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CREDENTIALS` can be supplied as a variable in which case the contents will be used to create an access token to the database and if successful, the variable will be saved to disk for future use. If you create another notebook and use the identical syntax, if the variable is not defined, the contents on disk will be used as the credentials. You should assign the credentials to a variable that represents the database (or schema) that you are communicating with. Using familiar names makes it easier to remember the credentials when connecting. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the credentials are assigned to a variable called sample:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sample = \\\n",
    "{\n",
    "... credentials ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "%sql connect credentials sample\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you open up a new notebook, you will not have to create the sample variable with the credentials in it.

Since tokens expire after a period of time, your SQL calls may stop working.
